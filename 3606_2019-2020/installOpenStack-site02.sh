## 20200115-01 - NS - Multiple updates. 
##                    Added timestamping. The script should be copied and pasted in a shell terminal
##                    Before executing the commands below, execute "sudo ls" to cache the password first.
## 20200115-02 - NS - NB: Very Important!!!, your local DNS server could prevent the script from connecting to the amazon web servers
##                    e.g. Connecting to github-production-release-asset-2e65be.s3.amazonaws.com (github-production-release-asset-2e65be.s3.amazonaws.com)|52.217.32.204|:443

##                    Please use a DNS server such as 8.8.8. or 1.1.1.1. You may have to add it manually on your local desktop or in your DHCP server add these as the first DNS servers.

## Testing to see if broken pipe will occur.
## Edit: 20200114-01 - Broken pipe error fixed. Not so sure why site01 script didn't have this error.
sudo chown -R stack:stack devstack/

cd devstack/

cat >  local.conf <<EOF
[[local|localrc]]
ADMIN_PASSWORD=secret
DATABASE_PASSWORD=\$ADMIN_PASSWORD
RABBIT_PASSWORD=\$ADMIN_PASSWORD
SERVICE_PASSWORD=\$ADMIN_PASSWORD
## Code below was from site01 script without the preceding slashes.
## DATABASE_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD
## RABBIT_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD
## SERVICE_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD
## EDIT: Comment out this comment [Use local host instead. Might get a broken pipe error --- Didn't solve the issue]
## Use localhost IP for when conencting to compute nodes via 6080.
## HOST_IP=10.0.2.15
HOST_IP=127.0.0.1
## EDIT: Comment out this comment [Try not to reclone, might get a proken pipe error --- Didn't solve the issue]
RECLONE=yes
## GIT_BASE was from another setup manual. Remove as required.
