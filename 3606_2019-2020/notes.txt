Connecting to consoles

instance console error [solved]


When connecting to the console remember that this is running in a VM. Which means port forwarding will have to be setup.
This installtion in Ubuntu the local instance ip addresses are based on the inital ip addresses used in the OpenStack installtion.
In this case the OpenStack VM uses ip address 10.0.2.15
the console URL will be similar to the following:
http://10.0.2.15:6080/vnc_lite.html?path=%3Ftoken%3Dba2d3d38-afd2-4b7c-b96a-83a8547ab922&title=compute01(149ba0c3-43d1-45b0-8791-3e9c91118e2f)

Configure port forwarding for port 6080.
Then take the URL and replace the 10.0.2.15 with 127.0.0.1

http://127.0.0.1:6080/vnc_lite.html?path=%3Ftoken%3Dba2d3d38-afd2-4b7c-b96a-83a8547ab922&title=compute01(149ba0c3-43d1-45b0-8791-3e9c91118e2f)
